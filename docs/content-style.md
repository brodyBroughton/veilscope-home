# Content Style Guide

## Core rules
- No hype, no persuasion, no predictions.
- Short sentences. Define jargon.
- Always emphasize transparency: sources, timestamps, user-controlled filters.

## Do say
- “Educational only. Not investment advice.”
- “Unbiased filtering of public data.”
- “Traceable to source filings.”
- “User-configurable screening thresholds.”

## Do NOT say
- “Buy / sell / hold”
- “Top picks / winners”
- “Guaranteed returns”
- “Undervalued / overvalued” (unless strictly defined as a metric, which we’re avoiding)

## Beginner-friendly patterns
- Tooltips for terms: SEC, EDGAR, 10-Q, 10-K, EPS, OCF, Relative Strength
- Use analogies sparingly:
  - “10-Q = quarterly report”
  - “EDGAR = SEC filing database”

## Disclosure placement
- Footer disclaimer on every page
- In-context disclaimers on:
  - Home hero (one line)
  - Pricing page near CTA
  - Any section describing the assistant

## CTA language
- “Open the App”
- “See methodology”
- “View updates”
Avoid: “Start winning”, “Get rich”, etc.
