# Page: Methodology (/methodology)

## Goal
Explain the “unbiased filtering” approach and define metrics at a high level.

## Sections
1) Core promise: filtering, not advice
2) Metrics (definitions + time windows)
- EPS
- Operating Cash Flow
- Revenue
- Relative Strength: 3M relative return vs QQQ
3) “As-of date” concept
4) Known limitations (data lags, filing cadence)
5) Links to Data Sources + Glossary

## Acceptance criteria
- Definitions are mechanical, not interpretive
- No “this means the stock is good/bad”
