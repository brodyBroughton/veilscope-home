# Page: Pricing (/pricing)

## Goal
Present tiers and benefits with placeholders (no payment processing here).

## Primary CTA
Open the App (external)

## Sections
1) Pricing header + disclosure
2) 3-tier table (placeholders)
- Free
- Pro
- Team (or Advanced)
Include placeholders for:
- screens/day
- saved screens
- assistant usage limits
- exports
- alerts (future)

3) “Transparent limits” block
- explain that tiers gate usage/features but do not change data integrity

4) FAQ accordion (pricing questions)

## Notes
- Mention billing provider (Stripe) only as “coming soon” if needed; no claims about pricing until set.

## Acceptance criteria
- Clear tiers
- Strong disclosure near CTA
