# Accessibility Rules

## Contrast
- Normal text must meet 4.5:1 contrast minimum.
- Large text can be 3:1, but avoid relying on that.

## Interaction
- Keyboard navigation must work for:
  - header nav
  - FAQ accordion
  - pricing links and CTAs

## Semantics
- One h1 per page
- Use landmarks: header/main/footer
- Buttons are buttons; links are links
